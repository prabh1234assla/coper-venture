i trusted you
cause i loved you;
i fell because i cared
u left because you could
.
why me?
why just me?
you smiled more happily with her
more louder were your laughs
with her
.
why me?
i was no good to you
gave myself to you
got fucked by you to make you feel good
what about my inner child
that died thousand deaths
everytime you said she tasted better
.
how many men will use me like discarded condoms
how many people will say i am toxic
when infact i was the one getting hurted
abused
ruined
and dying everyday
.
why me?
i am just a child
yes i like men
but i have soul too
why my voice is not better
ugly skin of me trying to love itself
.
but u kill me everytime
i am happy that u r happy
but u r gone
gone away
cause i was a man
who liked u
and u were a man
whose one time lust was just me
.
why me?
why fucking me?
why every fucking time it is me?
i am just a kid
maybe i like u
but my ugly skin
can be ur protection
when you will turn old
.
but guess what death
is better option
